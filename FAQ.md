Q. How come the vanilla ponydocs skin shipping with the extension doesn't look anything like docs.splunk.com?  
A. The web development team has greatly extended the skin shipping with ponydocs.
   Long term, the plan is to port all delta of features between the two so that the entire docs.splunk.com feature set is
   available in the ponydocs skin.
